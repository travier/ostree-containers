    # Fix /run/lock breakage since it's not tmpfs in docker
    # This unmounts /run (tmpfs) and then recreates the files
    # in the /run directory on the root filesystem of the container
    # NOTE: run this in nochroot because "umount" does not exist in chroot
    # umount /mnt/sysimage/run

    # The file that specifies the /run/lock tmpfile is
    # /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/legacy.conf, which is part of the systemd
    # rpm that isn't included in this image. We'll create the /run/lock
    # file here manually with the settings from legacy.conf
